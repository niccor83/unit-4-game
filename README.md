# unit-4-game


*__What the project does:__ The Crystal Collector app is a game.  Here is an overview of how the game works. At the start of each game the player is given a random number. There are four crystals. By clicking on a crystal a specific amount of points are added to the total score. The player wins the game by matching the total score to the random number, the player loses if the total score is more than the random number. The value of each crystal will be hidden until it is clicked. Each time the game starts the value of each crystal will change.
